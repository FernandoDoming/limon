tracy-safe-fork / internal_syscall:
- grep for SYS_ and __NR_ ; these can never be valid for multiple ABIs.

tracy_mmap / tracy_munmap
- should work, but may have problems with 64 bit program using 32 bit abi
    (temporarily), because we will probably want to use a 64 bit mmap.

Python bindings need to be updated. (Go bindings? â˜º)
